The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the app isn't properly initialized. This can happen if you try to access Firebase services before the `initializeApp` function has completed successfully. For instance, if you have asynchronous code that attempts to use Firebase features before the initialization finishes, you might encounter unexpected behavior or errors.  Another uncommon issue arises from improperly configured security rules in the Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore.  If your rules are too restrictive, legitimate client requests might be rejected.   Incorrectly handling asynchronous operations with Firebase can lead to race conditions. For example, if data fetching and UI updates occur without proper synchronization, you could end up displaying stale data.
