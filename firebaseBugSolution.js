To solve initialization issues, ensure that `initializeApp` is called before any other Firebase operations, perhaps using promises or async/await: 
```javascript
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
// ... other imports ...

const firebaseConfig = {
  // ... your config ...
};

initializeApp(firebaseConfig).then(() => {
  // Access Firebase services here, initialization is guaranteed to be complete
  console.log('Firebase initialized successfully!'); 
  //Your firebase code here
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('Firebase initialization failed:', error);
});
```
For security rule problems, check and carefully adjust your Firebase security rules in the console to allow only authorized access to data. Avoid overly restrictive rules to prevent blocking legitimate requests.
To resolve race conditions in asynchronous operations, use mechanisms like promises, async/await, or transactions to manage data fetching and UI updates appropriately.  Ensure that data updates are synchronized to avoid stale or incorrect display.
